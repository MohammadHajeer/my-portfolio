# 🧑‍💻 Ahmad Al-Rashid — Developer Portfolio

A modern, fully responsive developer portfolio built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. Features a clean dark/light mode toggle, smooth scroll animations, and a professional developer aesthetic inspired by tools like Supabase and Linear.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Dark / Light Mode** — Toggle with a single click; uses Tailwind `dark:` variants throughout
- **Smooth Animations** — Intersection-observer fade-ins on every section + CSS keyframe effects
- **Profile Photo** — Circular photo with floating geometric decorations and an indigo glow
- **Fully Responsive** — Mobile-first layout, adapts cleanly from small screens to wide desktops
- **Single Component** — Everything lives in one `portfolio.jsx` file, zero dependencies beyond React + Tailwind

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A React project with Tailwind CSS configured

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Copy portfolio.jsx into your project
cp portfolio.jsx src/pages/index.jsx   # or wherever your entry point is

# 2. Make sure Tailwind is set up with darkMode: 'class'
# tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: { extend: {} },
  plugins: [],
}

# 3. Run your dev server
npm run dev
```

### Tailwind Dark Mode Config

This portfolio uses **class-based** dark mode. Make sure your `tailwind.config.js` has:

```js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',   // ← required
  // ...
}
```

The component manages the `dark` class internally on its root wrapper — no extra configuration needed.

## 🖼️ Replacing the Profile Photo

The hero section loads a placeholder image from Unsplash. To use your own photo:

```jsx
// Find this line in portfolio.jsx:
src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?w=440&h=440&fit=crop&crop=face"

// Replace with your own image URL or local path:
src="/images/your-photo.jpg"
// or
src="https://your-cdn.com/photo.jpg"
```

The image is cropped to a circle (`rounded-full`, `object-cover`, `object-top`) — works best with a portrait/headshot photo.

---

## ✏️ Customization

### Personal Info

Search for these strings in `portfolio.jsx` and replace:

| Placeholder | Replace with |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Ahmad Al-Rashid` | Your full name |
| `hello@ahmadalrashid.dev` | Your email address |
| `linkedin.com/in/ahmad-alrashid` | Your LinkedIn URL |
| `github.com/ahmad-dev` | Your GitHub URL |
| `Software Engineer · Full-Stack Web Developer · CS Graduate` | Your title |

### Projects

Edit the `PROJECTS` array at the top of the file:

```js
const PROJECTS = [
  {
    title: "Your Project Name",
    desc:  "Short description of what it does and the problem it solves.",
    tags:  ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL"],
    status: "Live",   // "Live" | "Open Source" | "In Progress" | "Archived"
  },
  // ...
];
```

### Tech Stack

Edit the `TECH_STACK` array:

```js
const TECH_STACK = [
  { name: "React", icon: "⚛️", cat: "Frontend" },
  // add or remove entries freely
];
```

### Accent Color

The portfolio uses **indigo** as its primary accent. To switch to another color, do a find-and-replace:

```
indigo → blue      (cool, professional)
indigo → violet    (creative, bold)
indigo → sky       (light, modern)
indigo → emerald   (Supabase-style green)
```
